# RecordBreaker
McGill CodeJam Hackathon 2023
## What It Does
Record Breaker is a new social media platform that makes it easier for music fans to share their favorite tracks with friends, engage in competitive fun, connect with like-minded music enthusiasts, and capture daily music-related memories. Record Breaker also provides the opportunity for smaller or local artists to gain exposure and potentially break into the music industry. Not only can you support them and keep up to date with their music, you can also listen to their music recommendations! 

**Features**
On the main feed, the user will be prompted to share their current song of the day and also discover their friends’ top song picks. They’ll also have the power to vote for their favorite song with a gold disk vote (limited to one gold disk per day for that one exceptional song) as well as silver disks which represent regular likes. The user will also have the option to tighten their circles by creating groups to bring their friend groups together. Within the private groups, users can create friendly competition through leaderboards that highlight the top 3 musical tastes of the friend group. Users will also have the option to join public groups tailored to local artists, genres, and fanbases to connect with others who share niche musical preferences and find potential concert buddies. The profile page acts as a personalized music calendar, similar to that of BeReal but with a unique twist- while showcasing daily sign posts, there will also be the flexibility to keep it public or private. Record Breaker will also feature the user’s top artist of the month based on selections and shaping a profile that reflects the user’s musical personality. 

## How We Built It

## What's Next for Record Breaker?
The next record to break for Record Breaker would be to implement the functionalities we did not have time to implement such as introducing a ‘This is What You Were Listening to' feature reflecting users' music from a year ago, a 'Trending Songs' section, and eventually evolving into a comprehensive music platform with concert recommendations, in-app messaging for music discussions, and collaborative music activities!
