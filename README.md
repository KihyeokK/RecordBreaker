## What It Does
Record Breaker is a new social platform that makes it easier for music fans to share their favorite tracks with friends, engage in competitive fun, connect with like-minded music enthusiasts, and story tell their life through music. Record Breaker also provides the opportunity for smaller or local artists to gain exposure and potentially break into the music industry. Not only can you support them and keep up to date with their music, you can also listen to their music recommendations!

**Features** 
On the main feed, the user is prompted to share their current song of the day and are able to discover their friends’ top song picks. They have the power to vote for their favorite song(s) from their feed. The user also has the option to create private groups. Within the private groups, users can choose to have a friendly competition through leaderboards that highlight the top 3 musical tastes of the friend group making it a more interactive platform to keep users coming back. Users also have the choice to join public groups tailored to local artists, genres, and fanbases to connect with others who share niche musical preferences and find potential concert buddies. The profile page acts as a personalized music calendar, similar to that of BeReal but with a unique twist- while showcasing daily music posts, there is the flexibility to keep it public or private. Record Breaker shapes a profile that reflects the user’s musical personality.

## How We Built It
For our project, we used React.js for our frontend, which was designed using Figma, utilizing material-ui for many of our components. For our backend and database, we used Express.js and MongoDB Atlas. To get the song information as well as the album covers, we utilized the Spotify API to get the necessary data whenever a post is made.

## What's Next for Record Breaker?
The next record to break for Record Breaker would be to implement the functionalities we did not have time to implement such as introducing a ‘This is What You Were Listening to' feature reflecting users' music from a year ago, a 'Trending Songs' section, and eventually evolving into a comprehensive music platform with concert recommendations, in-app messaging for music discussions, and collaborative music activities!
